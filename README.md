### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Alan Li, a physics graduate interested in programming.

I love learning new skills and trying out new things. I have been particularly interested in machine learning since I found its applications in various fields of physics (such as quantum information and space weather forecasting) back when I was in university. I found the applications of machine learning even more exciting in the industry than in academia, which is why I joined AiCore, an industry-informed hands-on accelerator for AI and Machine Learning training. I eagerly want to see the power of machine learning in the real world, continuously develop new skills by following the progress of this fast-moving field, and master as many skills as I can in my twenties.
